### Working with minifier

The css minifier suggested in the book has been deprecated then I tried minify package which is completely useless, so I visited this site and it was able to minify my file for me, I just had to do copy and paste [link](https://www.minifier.org/)

I ended up using the cleanCSS package [clean-css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clean-css)
